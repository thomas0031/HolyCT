### TODOS:
- [ ] Refactor String, make it OOP like
- [ ] Add rust like Result/Option enums and helper methods, error handling is a must have
- [x] Remove vec<u8> and make it generic like hashmap
- [x] Clean up typedefs, split them from structs
- [ ] Think about including header implimintations inside other implimintations bcs of bad APIs (e.x vector get_raw_ptr) 
- [ ] Optimize string replace function (currently N * M i think)
- [ ] Optimize engine render function (currently N * M + huge memory reallocs)
- [ ] Add cache to the engine (don't want to rerender every time), think about timebased and check GC realizations for inspiration

- [ ] Prevent XSS in Engine->render
- [ ] Add conditionals and loops
- [ ] Fix static placesholders
